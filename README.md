# amysme

## Description:
This repository defines the implementation of the different services for the architectural solution for the AMYSME enterprise. It follows the monorepo development 
strategy.  

## Mono-Repository strategy:  
A monorepo is a single version-controlled code repository containing multiple distinct projects. While these projects may be related, they are often logically 
independent and run by different teams (Like in our case).  
It is extremely usefull because:  
  1- When different teams need visibility on the entirety of project.  
  2- Sharing team members expertise among projects with reduced delays.  
  3- Save time with less coding when using similar technologies and environments.  
  
## Mono-Repository strategy:  
The services projects are as follows:  
  1- **Web Portal**: webportal-back and webportal-front.
